# Project 2

In this section of the project, the goal of this project was to employ the fundamentals of survival analysis to answer many business questions associated to employee turn overs at different employee group levels of turn over. The previous analysis was superficial at many levels, as it has not employed deeper analysis and investigation on questions as follows
- What will be the effect of the result of analysis if it combine different event types?
- What are the attributes that increase of decrease the hazard rate?
- How the bonus does affects the turn over?
- Also, if there are any other significant factors which is affecting the turnover, like for example age of the employee etc.

So, in this 2nd part of the project we have tried to investigate these problems by employing both the competing risk concepts and predominantly using the Cox regression model for analysis of the time-dependent covariate.
